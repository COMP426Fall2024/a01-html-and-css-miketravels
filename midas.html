        <h1 class="subheading">The Golden Touch</h1>
        <p class="story">King Midas once found a satyr sleeping in his favorite flower bed. He decided to spare the creature of an ill punishment which brought good favor from the god Dionysus.
            Midas was allowed one wish by the god. He wished that everything he touched turned to gold. It didn't take long before the drawbacks of his gold
            lust became evident.
        </p>

        <p class="story">Midas' meals would turn to gold right as he was about to eat, which led him to starve. He tolerated this until his young
            daughter came up to give him a hug, with tragically predictable results. The king would beg for Dionysus to undo his foolish wish, to
            which the god agreed. He washed in the river Pactolus which turned the river sand into gold and the rest of his possessions back to normal.

        <h1 class="subheading">The Contest of Musicians</h1>
        <p class="story">One time, King Midas would end up acting as a judge in a contest between the God Apollo and the satyr Marsyas. While Apollo was undoubtedly
            the better musician, Midas, being a good friend of the satyrs, voted in favor of Marsyas. Apollo, disgusted by the king's choice challenged the satyr to play their
            instruments upside down. The god kept a heavenly tune while Marsyas struggled to make even a single note. Midas was forced to confess that
            Apollo was the better musician.
        </p>

        <p class="story">Apollo however was still bitter about Midas siding with Marsyas orginally. He declared that his ears or those of a donkey, thus he will have
            the ears of one. In embarassment, Midas wore peaked caps to hide his cursed ears from his subjects. Only his barber knew his secret. That secret though,
            wouldn't remain secret for long. The barber, under the weight of this private knowledge yelled into a hole of secluded field the truth about Midas' ears.
            The wind carried the secret to all corners of the world, ultimately resulting in Midas abdicating his throne and go into hiding for the rest of his life.
