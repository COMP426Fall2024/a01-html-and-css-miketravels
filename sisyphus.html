        <p>King Sisyphus was a king known across Greece for his wit that was able to fool even the gods of Olympus. His first bit of trickery was an exchange with the river-god Asopus. In return for a source of fresh water,
        Sisyphus revealed the location of the god's missing daugher who just so happened to beh having an affair with Zeus. The olympian was furious with the king for exposing his affairs, so he had Hades go find Sisyphus
        and punish him in the underworld. The unusual choice of messenger worked to Sisyphus' advantage. Sisyphus asked why Hades himself had come to escort him to the underworld instead of Hermes, the messenger of the gods,
        which had Hades himself pause and think on why it had been the case. By the time he was done thinking, the king had chained the god to a post.

        <p>With Hades at Sisyphus will, the cycle of death had paused, which brought chaos across the world. Sisyphus did eventuallly relent and let Hades go so the natural order could continue. Hermes would end up greeting
            the king this time round, though Sisyphus was not without his tricks. On his effective death bed, he told his wife not to put a coin under his tongue to pay for passage into the underworld. When Sisyphus arrived
            Hades was immensely confused why the great king had come as a beggar. He deduced that the king's wife was behind this and feared it could lead to a poor example in future. As such, he sent Sisyphus back to the realm
            of the living so he could teach his wife the proper customs for preparing the dead, all according to the king's plan. He ended up living together with his wife until old age finally claimed him. So that the king would
            not have the oppotunity to come up with any more tricks to make the gods look even more foolish, Sisyphus was instructed to push a boulder to the top of a hill. However, the boulder would always slip right before reaching
            the top, forcing the king to repeat the process again and again.
