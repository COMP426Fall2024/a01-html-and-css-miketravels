        <p class="story">There was once a king called Acrisius who had a single child named Danae, who a was said to be a heavenly beauty. Acrisius had sealed his daugher away, due to an oracle's warning That
            his grandson would kill him one day. While she was safe from mortal eyes, the same could not be said for the gods up above. Danae would end up having a child with Zeus to Acrisius's horror. Realizing
            he couldn't directly harm the child, he put his daughter and grandson in a chest and tossed it into the sea.
        </p>

        <p class="story">The chest, however safely made it to a small island, where the child known as Perseus lived a realtively peaceful life. However, the king of the island had his eye on Danae and desired to make
            her his own. He knew he couldn't make his move while Perseus was around, so he sent him off to be betrothed to a princess in a neigboring land. The custom of the land was to bring a gift as tribute to the king,
            however, Perseus was so poor, he couldn't afford a gift. So instead, the king of the island had him set off to bring him the head of Medusa, a Gorgon that could turn anyone to stone with just a gaze. The youth
            agreed to the terms and set off, though not without some divine intervention. Athena lent him her shield while Hermes gave him his sword to protect him on his journey.
        </p>

        <p class="story">Perseus' first stop was to visit the Gray Sisters so that he may learn of the location of the Gorgons. The sisters, true to their name, were gray from their flesh, to their hair, to the singular eye
            they shared between them. With a deft hand, Perseus snatched the eye and threatned to keep it if they didn't reveal the Gorgon's lair. The sisters relunctantly agreed and Perseus was off again, this time with an
            additional gift from Hermes in the form of his winged sandals. The youth didn't take long to reach their lair. Knowing of their danger, he took a precaustionary measure by looking into his shield which acted like a mirror.
            The deed was done with a single stroke. He made a hasty escape before the remaining sisters could catch up to him. A winged horse known as Pegasus would emerge from the neck stump of the decapitated Gorgon sister.

        <p class="story">During the return trip, he saw the princess Andromeda chained to a rock. Her parents had once boasted that her beauty was even greater than Poseidon's daughters, which the god of the seas responded by sending a 
            sea monster to destroy their kingdom. They figured that Posedion would be appeased if their daughter was given up as a sacrifice. Perseus decided he couldn't lay idle and slained the monster right as it was about to eat 
            Andromeda. Perseus returned Andromeda to her kingdom where her unsavory suitor was waiting with a small army to take her. Perseus used Medusa's head to turn the suitor and his forces into stone before heading home with Andromeda.
        </p>

        <p class="story">Upon arriving home, Perseus learned that the king of island tried to claim his mother as his bride. Thankfully, she had escaped, but Perseus wanted vengeance. In anger, he pulled out the head the king had wanted,
            turning him to stone. The people of the island hailed Perseus and Andromeda as their new king and queen. Perseus would end up returning the objects he had borrowed form the gods, in additon to handing other the head of Medusa 
            to Athena, as it was too dangerous to be left in the hands of mortals.
        </p>

        <p class="story">In the years that followed, Perseus would end up returning to his birth city of Argos, where we would be proclaimed king as his grandfather had fled the city after hearing of his approach.
            During one sporting event, Perseus was playing discus when a gust of wind changed its trajectory and killed one of the specators. That specator was Acrisius, and the oracle's words had become the truth.
